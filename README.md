# TTD-DR: Test-Time Diffusion Deep Research

A sophisticated AI-powered research system that implements test-time diffusion methodology for comprehensive, multi-faceted research using Kimi API and LangGraph orchestration.

## Overview

TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion Deep Research) is an advanced research automation system that leverages the power of Kimi AI and LangGraph workflows to conduct deep, iterative research with self-evolution capabilities. The system implements test-time diffusion principles to iteratively refine research quality through multiple rounds of gap analysis and content enhancement.

## Features

- **Test-Time Diffusion Methodology**: Iterative research refinement with quality scoring
- **Multi-Engine Search Integration**: Supports Tavily, DuckDuckGo, and Naver search APIs
- **Self-Evolution System**: Automatic gap identification and content enhancement
- **Multi-Faceted Research**: Handles complex, multi-dimensional research queries
- **Kimi API Integration**: Optimized for Moonshot AI's Kimi model
- **Comprehensive State Management**: Full research lifecycle tracking with LangGraph
